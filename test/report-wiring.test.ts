// report.ts is a program, not a module — it runs on require (exits on
// missing USERNAME/API_KEY and writes to .env on first run), so there's
// no ergonomic way to unit-test its call-site wiring. Extracting a
// testable body-builder would introduce a lot of surface churn for a
// narrow guarantee.
//
// This is a single grep-style guard against the original scrubbing bug:
// reintroducing REPORT_DAYS coupling to the rolling-window blob fields
// (session_stats, cursor_stats), which the server stores wholesale and
// would therefore lose history on short REPORT_DAYS runs.
//
// Why only cursor_stats here, not session_stats: the session_stats path
// is covered behaviorally by `report-e2e.test.ts` (it asserts that
// agentsview is invoked with `--since 28d` even when REPORT_DAYS=1).
// cursor_stats is harder to E2E (would need a stub better-sqlite3 DB),
// so the wiring grep stays as the cheaper-than-a-fixture coverage.
// Drop this test once an equivalent E2E for cursor lands.

// Grep the TypeScript source, not the compiled output — TS rewrites
// import names (`collectCursorStats` → `cursor_1.collectCursorStats`)
// which would break our patterns. After build, this test lives in
// dist/test/, so the source is two levels up at PROJECT_ROOT/reporter.
